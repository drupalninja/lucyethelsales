<h3>Why have an estate liquidation?</h3>
<p>Downsizing to a smaller home - a long-distance move - senior citizen setting - death of a parent of family member - a divorce situation - to settle an estate. An on-site estate sale is a fast, practical way to turn no-longer-needed assets into cash!</p>
<h3>Why use professionals to handle the sale?</h3>
<p>The emotional impact of an owner moving from a beloved home or felt by family members who have lost a loved one make it difficult to handle the preparation and selling of an estate in a sound, businesslike fashion needed to achieve the best financial results.  Family members might not recognize the value of some items. The brown vase that sat on Aunt Dorothy's mantle for as long as anyone can remember might be a piece of pottery worth $200.  Experienced, knowledgeable professionals can accurately price and sell everything from normal household furnishings and knickkacks to valuable artwork and collectibles.  For family members living outside the area of the sale, it is more convenient to use professionals who specialize in the local market and have experience with permit requirements, advertising avenues, and other promotional opportunities.  We offer full turnkey service from initial evaluation, pricing and sale of an estate, to final disposition of remaining items.</p>
<h3>How much does it cost?</h3>
<p>Our commission structure for preparation and sale of personal and household assets, including disposal of unsold items, is competitive with regional pricing. In fairness to all parties, we ask to view an estate before quoting a price - as location, size and condition of the estate are considerations. The combination of our caring and well-trained sales staff, our advertising expertise, and an established customer base offer you the "value added" service you're looking for. A written expense quote will be provided to you at the time the estate is viewed and evaluated.</p>
<h3>Can we accept every sale?</h3>
<p>Sadly, no. Location, date and time restrictions, size and condition of the estate assets are the primary factors to consider. Sometimes other options are available which may be a more appropriate method of liquidation than an on-site sale. We're happy to explain these options and provide our recommendations.</p>
<h3>What is the first step?</h3>
<p>We're as close as a phone call or email. Even if you do not anticipate an immediate sale but know that you are likely to need our services in the near future, we can advise you on timing and scheduling of your sale.</p>
<h3>Why choose our team for your sale?</h3>
