<p><strong>HOW TO GET STARTED</strong></p>
<p>Give us a call or drop us an email.&nbsp; We’re first interested in 3 details.&nbsp; What part of Dallas or the suburbs is the home in?&nbsp; Has the house been vacated, or when will it be vacated?&nbsp; Has the home been sold – if yes, when is closing?</p>
<p>LUCY &amp; ETHEL DO ESTATE SALES! specializes in the areas of Richardson, Lake Highlands, Lakewood, White Rock and north Dallas.&nbsp; We will sometimes work outside those areas depending on sale size.&nbsp; </p>
<p>When an owner downsizes, relocates to a retirement facility, or when a family has the difficult and sometimes overwhelming job of emptying a home after the death of a loved one, it is helpful to have an educated eye judge the potential for a professional estate liquidation.&nbsp; It is most efficient to invite us for an interview after any items chosen for removal by family members has been finalized.</p>
<p>When you contact us, we’ll want to send you our DON’T THROW IT AWAY list, either in print or by email.&nbsp; When a major move or home cleanout is needed, sometimes good, sellable things can get thrown away by the owner or family – did you know that empty perfume bottles and old postcards and valentines are very sellable?&nbsp; Did you know that costume jewelry, not just fine jewelry, is very, very sellable?&nbsp; Let us do the work – this is where experience PAYS OFF!</p>
<p><u><strong>SUGGESTIONS:</strong></u></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>FIRST gather up personal papers, pictures, that you want saved, and plan to remove those things first.&nbsp; As we’re prepping, if we find anything we think you missed, we will contact you and put those items in a safe place for you.&nbsp; Don’t worry – we have even uncovered diamond and ruby rings and Grandpa’s birth certificate – we’ll save them for you!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>DO NOT throw things away – DO NOT sell things in a garage sale or to interested neighbors or on the internet – DO NOT give things away until your estate sale professional has seen the contents of the home.&nbsp; Sometimes a potential sale falls beneath the value of what would be practical for a sale – and this because of generous owners or family members who “got rid of things” before they called us.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>NEED to speak to an experienced realtor in your area?&nbsp; Moving company?&nbsp; We have those contacts for you too!</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>There’s no charge for an interview – and of course no obligation to use our services – but you’ll like what we have to offer!</p>
