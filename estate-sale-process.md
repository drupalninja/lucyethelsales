<p>LUCY &amp; ETHEL DO ESTATE SALES! can handle an estate liquidation or major moving/downsizing sale for you, with experience ~ dependability ~ and respect.&nbsp; We treat every sale with meticulous attention to detail, which results in the best possible outcomes for our clients.</p>
<ul>
<li>We empty closets, cabinets and sheds, look with trained eyes at furniture, decorations, collectibles and all household and personal items in a home&nbsp; – we throw out the trash and do “setup” on everything sellable so an attractive and well-displayed presentation awaits customers on sale days.</li>
<li>As we price everything in the home, we research valuable items to determine market values.&nbsp; Where warranted, we call in outside experts for appraisals – many times where a sale includes a doll collection, Indian artifacts, antiques, art, Orientalia, etc., -- and Lucy &amp; Ethel! adds these services at our own expense.</li>
<li>Widespread advertising is done for each sale.&nbsp; We have an extensive email list of people to invite to a sale, plus we do newspaper and internet ads with photography.&nbsp; All advertising is done at Lucy &amp; Ethel’s expense.</li>
<li>When the sale is over, we can finish the chore of getting to an empty house situation.&nbsp; We can recommend a good resale shop and handle delivery – again at our expense – of sellable items for you.&nbsp; Other leftovers that are only suitable for donation to charity will be handled for you as well – and we’ll secure a tax receipt and make an inventory of those donated things for you, for your tax records.&nbsp; Then we’ll sweep and vacuum and hand you or your realtor the key to an empty house!</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong>&nbsp; We have worked with dozens of families, are very “senior friendly,” and can offer information and contacts to help make a major move or the settling of a loved one’s estate easier for you.&nbsp; There are no up-front or hidden expenses – and we do all the work!</p>
