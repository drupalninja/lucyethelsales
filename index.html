  <h1 class="page-heading">Welcome to LUCY & ETHEL DO ESTATE SALES!</h1>

  <div class="content">
    <p>After 20 years in estate liquidation, my team and I retired at the end of 2018 doing business as LUCY & ETHEL DO ESTATE SALES. Yes, retirement is good!</p>

<p>If you need names of experienced liquidators in the Dallas, Richardson, Garland area, I’m glad to help. Just send an email request to <a href="mailto:SCAL36@tx.rr.com;">SCAL36@tx.rr.com</a>. This site will remain open because there is info that might be useful to you as you plan a sale.</p>

<p>For years I have promised - or threatened - to write a book about my own and other liquidators’ adventures in the world of doing estate sales. Now that I’m retired from the day-to-day business, the book is HAPPENING! My own collection of stories includes thrillers like “The snake under the bed,” “There’s a skeleton under the sofa” and “Why is there a police helicopter hovering over the house?” Stories from other liquidators - local and around the country - are included. Interesting info like the history of Blue Willow pottery and Lane cedar chests. Glossary of  “Estate Sale Words” - ANTIMACASSAR is my favorite ... and MORE!</p>

    <p>The site for my work in progress is <a href="http://>www.estatesaletales.com/">www.estatesaletales.com</a>. There is a link to be notified when I’m actually in print - and a link to submit your favorite estate sale story. Thanks for checking in!"</p>

<p>I think until we get FB finished lemme just redirect <a href="http://>www.estatesaletales.com/">estatesaletales.com</a> to your Facebook page. Let's focus on getting that 100%. I can update LucyEthelSales ASAP if that's the content you want.</p>

      <p>Also thanks for returning Mr. Elephant safe and sound. Love you!</p>
